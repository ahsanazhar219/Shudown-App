# Windows Shutdown App

**Description:**

This Python application provides a user-friendly graphical interface to quickly perform various shutdown actions on Windows systems.

**Features:**

- Restart the computer immediately.
- Restart the computer after a 10-second delay.
- Log off the current user.
- Shut down the computer completely.

**Requirements:**

- Python 3.x
- tkinter library (usually included with Python)

**Usage:**

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the Python script.
3. Execute the script using the command: `python shutdown_app.py`
4. The application window will appear.
5. Click the desired button to perform the corresponding action.

**Important Notes:**

- **Administrative Privileges:** Some actions, such as shutdown and restart, may require administrative privileges. If you encounter errors, try running the script as an administrator.
- **Data Loss Prevention:** Ensure you save any open work before initiating shutdown or restart actions to avoid potential data loss.
- **Customization:** The code can be modified to adjust button text, appearance, or delay times as needed.

**Troubleshooting:**

- If the application does not launch or functions incorrectly, verify that you have Python and tkinter installed correctly.
- Check for any syntax errors in the Python script.
- If encountering permission-related issues, run the script with administrative privileges.
